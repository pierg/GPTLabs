class FeedForward(nn.Module):
    """
    Defines a simple feedforward neural network module used within the Transformer architecture,
    featuring an expanded hidden layer to increase the model's capacity for learning complex functions.
    The expansion factor (i.e. 4) is a empirical choice in the original Transformer model in the paper "Attention is All You Need".
    This design choice follows the principle of increasing the dimensionality of the intermediate layer
    to provide a richer representation space before compressing the outputs back to the original dimension.
